# sql_Task5 : SQL Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full)

## Objective

This task focuses on exploring different types of SQL JOINs to combine information from related tables. The aim is to understand how each join type affects the final result set.

## Tools Used

MySQL Workbench

## Deliverables

sql_Task5.sql→ contains SQL queries for:

INNER JOIN – Matching rows from both tables

LEFT JOIN – All from left + matching from right

RIGHT JOIN – All from right + matching from left

FULL JOIN – All rows from both tables

CROSS JOIN (optional) – Cartesian product

## Key Concepts Practiced

Creating related tables (Customers, Orders)

Joining tables based on foreign keys

Understanding differences between INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL joins

Using UNION to simulate FULL JOIN in SQLite

## Outcome

Learned to merge data across related tables.

Understood how different JOIN types control the inclusion of unmatched rows.
